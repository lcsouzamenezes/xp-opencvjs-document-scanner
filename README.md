# Experiment with in-browser document reconginition

This is an experiment to use OpenCV.js (a Web.ASM cross compilation of the library) to recognize text on documents with
hand scanned images.

## Running Examples

You'll need to place an image in `htdocs/test.jpg` which you would like to recognize.

```shell script
$ npm install
$ http-serve htdocs -o
```
